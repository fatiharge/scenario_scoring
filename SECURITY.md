#Security Policy and Disclosures
##Security Policy
We, [scenario_scoring/fatiharge], believe that security is a serious matter. We make every effort to ensure the security of our data. However, no software system or application is entirely secure, so we appreciate the contributions of our community and researchers in detecting or reporting any security vulnerabilities.

##Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you have discovered any security vulnerabilities, please report them to us as soon as possible.

Please describe your security vulnerability in detail and provide reproduction instructions or screenshots if possible. Upon receiving your security vulnerability report, we will immediately begin working on it and keep you informed.

##Converting Your Security Vulnerabilities into Development Contributions
Finding and reporting security vulnerabilities is a significant contribution. We appreciate such contributions and offer you the opportunity to assist us in fixing your security vulnerability. If you report a security vulnerability, please indicate that you would be willing to be a part of the solution and contribute to our development process.
